ReadBy is constantly expanding its capabilities to better serve its users, and the latest developments include the addition of Content-Net and Smart Report features, as well as an upcoming GPT-4-based longer summary function.

## Content-Net

The Content-Net feature utilizes AI technology to track and trace the content that users read, making it easier to find and connect relevant articles and information. By analyzing the keywords and themes present in the user's saved articles, Content-Net can identify related content and suggest new articles to read, creating a network of connected information.

## Smart Report

In addition to Content-Net, ReadBy also offers Smart Report, a feature that generates daily or weekly reports summarizing the most important news and information related to the user's interests. Smart Report uses AI algorithms to analyze the user's saved articles and produce a concise report that highlights the most relevant information.

## Longer Summary

Looking to the future, ReadBy is also planning to release a longer summary feature based on GPT-4 technology. This feature will enable the app to produce more detailed and nuanced summaries, offering users an even deeper understanding of the content they read. With these new features and developments, ReadBy is positioning itself as a leading app for summarizing and analyzing content with the help of AI technology.
